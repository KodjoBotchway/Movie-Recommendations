# Movie Recommendations Using Collaborative Filtering
This was a code set that was used to create a simple recommendation system based on the collaborative filtering. Basically, a recommendation system is a continuous body of inforamtion that serves to make predictions and offer relevant options or items to the users.\
These items could be used as the models for recommending:
* Movies and TV shows, as shown in this case
* Items to purchase in online stores
* Courses to take on a learning platform
* Job searches and connection suggestions as used on platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook. etc.

The rest of the datasets can be obtained from https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/data/moviedataset.zip. The readme file containing information for the datafiles used to build the algorithm are in the data folder.  

The codes as shown in this github repository is used to suggest movies based on the ratings of the user for particular movies till the year 2016 and the general overview of other users or viewers in general. The training datasets can be added upon at any time to further improve matched suggestions. This work could also be extended to other sources of information as listed above.
